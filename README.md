Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository_url]
cd Top_12_German_Companies_Analysis
Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Packages

bash
Copy code
pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you have an updated version of Node.js installed locally, as it may be required for Jupyter extensions.

Usage
1. Data Cleaning
Run the data cleaning script to process the raw data.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
What This Does:

Reads the raw CSV file from data/raw/Top_12_German_Companies.csv.
Cleans and processes the data (handles missing values, converts data types, formats columns).
Saves the cleaned data to data/processed/cleaned_data.csv.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the data interactively.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Steps:

Open Notebooks:

Navigate to the notebooks/ directory.
Open eda.ipynb for exploratory data analysis.
Open visualization.ipynb for generating visualizations and insights.
Run Cells:

Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
Modify and experiment with the code as needed.
Alternatively, run the analysis scripts directly from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/eda.py
python scripts/visualization.py
Note: The scripts will generate outputs and figures in the reports/ directory.

Packages Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Numerical computing.
matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.
seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
jupyter: Interactive notebooks for exploratory analysis.
Node.js: Required for some JupyterLab extensions (ensure it's updated).
Results
Reports:

reports/eda_report.md: Findings from the exploratory data analysis.
reports/insights.md: Key insights and conclusions drawn from the data.
Visualizations:

Stored in reports/figures/, including:
revenue_vs_income.png
profit_margin_percentage.png
correlation_matrix.png
Other relevant figures.
